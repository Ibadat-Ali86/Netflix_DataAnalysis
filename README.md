Netflix Data Analysis Project 🎥🍿
Overview 📊
This project conducts a comprehensive analysis of a Netflix movie dataset to uncover trends and insights about movie releases, genres, popularity, and audience reception. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle (ibadatali/netflix-dataanalysis), contains information on 9,827 movies, including release dates, genres, popularity scores, vote counts, and vote averages. Using Python 🐍 with libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib, the project cleans, processes, and visualizes the data to answer key questions about movie trends.
The analysis includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) 📊 and advanced investigations to reveal patterns in genre popularity, release trends, and audience preferences. Visualizations make the findings accessible and engaging.
Project Objectives 🎯

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing 🧹: Handle data types, remove unnecessary columns, and address missing values or outliers.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 🔍: Answer fundamental questions about genre frequency, popularity, and release years.
Advanced Analysis 📈: Explore temporal trends, genre popularity over time, correlations, and top-rated movies by genre.
Data Visualization 📊: Create insightful plots, including histograms, line plots, and bar plots, to illustrate trends.

Dataset 📂
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle (ibadatali/netflix-dataanalysis) and includes 9,827 rows and 9 columns. Key columns are:

Title 🎬: Movie title
Release_Date 🗓️: Release date of the movie
Genre 🎭: Comma-separated genres
Popularity ⭐: Popularity score
Vote_Count 🗳️: Number of votes
Vote_Average 🌟: Average vote score
Overview, Original_Language, Poster_Url: Dropped during preprocessing as they were not used in the analysis

Key Preprocessing Steps 🛠️

Converted Release_Date to datetime and extracted the year 🗓️.
Dropped irrelevant columns (Overview, Original_Language, Poster_Url) 🚮.
Categorized Vote_Average into four groups: "not popular," "below average," "average," and "popular" ✅.
Split and exploded the Genre column for analysis 🎭.
Addressed missing values by dropping rows with NaNs 🗑️.

Project Structure 📑
The project is contained in a single Python script: copy_of_netflixdata_analysis.py. The script is organized as follows:

Data Import and Setup 📥:
Imports the dataset using the Kaggle API 🔑.
Loads libraries: Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib 🛠️.


Data Cleaning and Preprocessing 🧹:
Converts Release_Date to year format.
Drops unnecessary columns.
Categorizes Vote_Average using a custom function.
Splits and explodes the Genre column.


Exploratory Data Analysis 🔍:
Analyzes genre frequency, vote distribution, and popularity metrics 📊.
Identifies movies with the highest and lowest popularity ⭐.
Examines movie release distribution by year 🗓️.


Advanced Analysis 📈:
Temporal analysis of movie releases 📅.
Trends in popularity and genre popularity over time 📉.
Correlation analysis between Popularity and Vote_Count 📊.
Distribution of popularity and vote metrics 📈.
Impact of release year on popularity and vote averages 📅.
Identification of top movies by genre based on vote count 🌟.


Data Visualization 📊:
Visualizes genre distribution, vote distribution, and release trends 📉.
Plots correlations and distributions using scatter plots, histograms, and line plots 📈.



Key Findings 🏆

Most Frequent Genre 🎭: Drama is the most common genre, appearing in over 14% of movies.
Popularity and Voting 🌟:
25.5% of movies are categorized as "popular" based on Vote_Average ✅.
Spider-Man: No Way Home has the highest popularity (Action, Adventure, Science Fiction) 🦸‍♂️.
The United States, Thread has the lowest popularity (Music, Drama, War, Sci-Fi, History) 🎶.


Release Trends 🗓️: 2020 was the peak year for movie releases in the dataset 📈.
Genre Popularity Trends 🎭: Drama consistently ranks high in popularity, especially for movies with "average" vote ratings.
Correlation 📊: A weak positive correlation (0.146) exists between Popularity and Vote_Count.
Temporal Trends 📅: Movie releases increased steadily from the 1960s, peaking in 2020. Average popularity and vote counts show fluctuations over time.

Example Visualizations 📊
Below are descriptions of key visualizations generated by the project. (Note: Actual images would be included in the GitHub repository under an images/ folder.)

Genre Distribution 🎭:

Description: A bar plot showing the frequency of each genre, with Drama as the most frequent.
